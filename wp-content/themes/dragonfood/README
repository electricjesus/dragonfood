This is a MVC framework for help you develop your theme. It use internal function of WordPress and wrapped it in object oriented style.
Basically it has 2 components, model and view components.
The model component will wrapped WordPress components like post, category, tag, author, etc.
The view component will use as template separator between business logic and interface file.
The controller will handle by regular template file like index.php, front.php, single.php, etc in your theme directory.

Update:
Feb 1, 2011:
Replace repo with sample theme that used this framework. The sample theme still buggy but I hope It can show you how to use the framework in your theme.
